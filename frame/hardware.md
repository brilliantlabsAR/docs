## Bluetooth MCU

the Bluetooth MCU serves as the main processor for Frame. It handles all network communication and running of user logic. The MCU used is the [nRF52840](https://www.nordicsemi.com/products/nrf52840) from Nordic. It contains a 32bit ARM Cortex-M4F CPU running at 64MHz, 1 MB of flash storage, 256 KB of RAM, and features Bluetooth 5.3 connectivity.

As standard, Frame comes with a feature rich Lua based OS that allows for scripting and remote access fully over Bluetooth. No programming cables, or proprietary software is needed to use the device.

The firmware is fully updatable over the air. If you're using a Frame compatible app, these updates should be automatic, however if you're developing your own apps, take a look at the [Building Apps](/frame/building-apps-bluetooth-specs/#firmware-updates) page to see how you can implement firmware update capability into your own apps.

### Customizing the firmware

Frame is intended to be used with the officially provided firmware from Brilliant, however it is possible to customize the firmware if desired. Note that this will require destructive disassembly of your Frame hardware to access the physical debug port.

If you wish to view the source code, or use it as a starting point for your custom firmware, visit the [Frame codebase repository](https://github.com/brilliantlabsAR/frame-codebase).

The physical debug port of the Bluetooth MCU is located on the back of the Frame PCB. A total of five wires can be connected to a suitable ARM SWD debugger such as a [J-Link probe](https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/) or [Black-Magic probe](https://black-magic.org) to allow for debugging.

## FPGA

The FPGA is used for graphics acceleration of the display, as well as interfacing to the 720p camera sensor. It communicates to the Bluetooth MCU via SPI and is dynamically shutdown off to save power.

The FPGA used is the [Crosslink-NX LIFCL-17](https://www.latticesemi.com/Products/FPGAandCPLD/CrossLink-NX) from Lattice. It features 17k logic cells, 432kb of embedded block RAM, and 2.56Mb of large RAM.

If you wish to view the source code, or use it as a starting point for a custom RTL design, visit the [FPGA section](https://github.com/brilliantlabsAR/frame-codebase/tree/main/source/fpga) of the Frame codebase repository.

The FPGA does not expose a physical programming interface. Therefore the FPGA application is uploaded solely via SPI at boot-up.

## Display

The display used in Frame is a 0.23" micro OLED. It features 640x400 RGB pixels and is optically bonded to the prism assembly which directs the image into the user's eye. The result is a transparent floating display with a 20° field of view, and appears about the size of a tablet display at arms length.

The display is connected to the FPGA in 8bit YCbCr mode. 4 wires for the Y channel, and 2 wires each for the Cb and Cr channels. This allows for a total of 255 possible colors shown on the display. In turn, to save memory and ensure fast frame rates, the FPGA RTL is optimized to display a maximum of 16 colors per frame. These colors can be changed on the fly, allowing for large sprite sets and fonts to be efficiently stored within Frame's embedded memory. To better understand how the graphics subsystem of Frame works, check out the [graphics section](https://github.com/brilliantlabsAR/frame-codebase/blob/main/docs/fpga-architecture.md#graphics) of the Frame codebase repository.

## Camera

The front facing camera sensor on Frame is the incredibly small and power efficient [OV09734](https://www.ovt.com/products/ov09734-h16a-2a/) from Omnivision.

The FPGA RTL optimizes images for AI applications such as image recognition and allows the user a large amount of control over resolution, gain and exposure for maximum flexibility.

Images are captured as 1280x720 RGB, but then cropped to 720x720 and converted to YCbCr for memory efficiency and fast downloading over Bluetooth. To better understand how the camera subsystem of Frame works, check out the [camera section](https://github.com/brilliantlabsAR/frame-codebase/blob/main/docs/fpga-architecture.md#camera) of the Frame codebase repository.

## Microphone

Frame features a single [ICS-41351](https://product.tdk.com/system/files/dam/doc/product/sw_piezo/mic/mems-mic/data_sheet/ds-000157-ics-41351-v1.4.pdf) MEMS microphone from TDK. It has a wide dynamic range from -35.5dB to 129.5dB, allowing it to hear everything from soft speech, to loud booming noises.

The microphone is connected directly to the Bluetooth MCU which allows for low power operation and applications such as periodic recording and wake detection. The standard firmware allows for a wide range of recording formats from 4bits to 16bits sample depth, and 4kHz to 20kHz sample rate.

![Position of the microphone on Frame](/frame/images/frame-microphone.png)

## Motion Sensor (IMU)

The IMU on Frame is the 6 axis [MC6470](https://eu.mouser.com/datasheet/2/821/MC6470_Datasheet_APS_048_0033v1_7_1-3003085.pdf) sensor from MEMSIC. It features both an accelerometer and e-compass in a tiny package consuming very little power. Further processing on the Bluetooth MCU calculates the raw X, Y and Z values of both sensing elements into angular values for detecting head position. 

An accelerator interrupt line from the IMU is also directly connected to the Bluetooth MCU. This allows for always on detections of taps that can be used to navigate and select UI elements within the user's apps.

## Power

Power is internally distributed within Frame via the [MAX77654](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/max77654.pdf) power management IC from Analog Devices. Each rail is carefully managed and monitored to both protect the components within Frame, as well as ensure lasting performance of the battery.

{: .warning }
> The PMIC is configured from C code baked into the Bluetooth MCU firmware. If you're creating a custom firmware, it's recommended to avoid changing any of the PMIC settings without carefully studying the schematics and PMIC datasheet. These settings can easily over-volt components damaging them, as well as damage the battery.

### Battery charging

The PMIC includes an integrated battery charger for the two built in 105mAh li-ion cells. Regulation is based on time, temperature and the current operating state of Frame. An analog pin provides the ability to monitor battery voltage and current within the firmware, and can be used to estimate battery life.

## Charging cradle (Mister Power)

The charging cradle functions to both charge Frame via the 5V terminal on the back of the glasses, as well as allowing for factory resetting and un-pairing of Frame from any connected device.

It also contains a 140mAh rechargeable li-ion cell which allows for a top-up of Frame's internal battery while on the go. The charging cradle itself, and in turn Frame, can be charged using any USB Type-C power supply.
