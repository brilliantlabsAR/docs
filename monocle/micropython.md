# MicroPython API
{: .no_toc }

---

With MicroPython, you can rapidly prototype and develop applications without delving into low-level programming. Just a few lines of Python code allow you to draw on the display, access the camera, and leverage the FPGA for processing. Plus, you enjoy all the advantages of Python. The best part? It's completely wireless, and you can access the Python REPL seamlessly over Bluetooth.

The [MicroPython firmware for Monocle](https://github.com/brilliantlabsAR/monocle-micropython) is a customized version based on the upstream [MicroPython project](https://github.com/monocle/micropython). Thanks to the thriving MicroPython community, we continuously update our firmware to incorporate new features from the upstream project.

Currently, a subset of the standard MicroPython libraries is supported, with periodic additions. We have also included additional modules that facilitate easy interaction with the Monocle hardware. To familiarize yourself with all the features, make sure to explore the [MicroPython docs site](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/index.html) and our own documentation.

{: .highlight }
- The [introduction video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fo8jUKMMFs) is using the former version of the API.
- Before trying anything, you might want to update the firmware and FPGA by visiting <https://repl.brilliant.xyz> and following the indications or [manually](/monocle/update).

---

The REPL enables you to explore the hardware capabilities and prototype your applications line by line before final implementation.

As you embark on building your applications, you can conveniently save them directly onto your Monocle device. Upon booting up, Monocle will automatically attempt to execute a `main.py` file if you have created one. Using the [Brilliant AR Studio](/monocle/building-apps/#getting-started-with-ar-studio-for-vscode), you can easily create, save, and edit files directly on your Monocle.

Typing `help('modules')` lists all the modules contained on the device:

```
>>> help('modules')
__main__          asyncio/core      display           os
_asyncio          asyncio/event     errno             random
_camera           asyncio/funcs     fpga              re
_display          asyncio/lock      gc                select
_mountfs          asyncio/stream    hashlib           struct
_rtt              binascii          io                sys
_splashscreen     bluetooth         json              time
_test             builtins          led               touch
_update           camera            math              uasyncio
array             collections       microphone        update
asyncio/__init__  device            micropython       vgr2d
Plus any modules on the filesystem
```

To explore a specific module, import it, and call `help(module_name)`:

```
>>> import device
>>> help(device)
object <module ''> is of type module
  NAME -- monocle
  mac_address -- <function>
  VERSION -- v23.181.0720
  GIT_TAG -- 813d559bc
  GIT_REPO -- https://github.com/brilliantlabsAR/monocle-micropython
  battery_level -- <function>
  reset -- <function>
  reset_cause -- <function>
  prevent_sleep -- <function>
  force_sleep -- <function>
  is_charging -- <function>
  Storage -- <class 'Storage'>
```

### `device` – Monocle specific

> The device class contains general information about the Monocle's hardware and firmware.

| Members | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| `NAME` **constant**                           | Constant which holds `'monocle'` as a **string**.
| `mac_address()` **function**                  | Returns the 48-bit MAC address as a 17 character **string** in the format `'xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx'`, where each `xx` is a byte in lowercase hex format.
| `VERSION` **constant**                        | Constant containing the firmware version as a 12 character **string**. E.g. `'v22.342.1252'`.
| `GIT_TAG` **constant**                        | Constant containing the build git tag as a 9 character **string**.
| `GIT_REPO` **constant**                       | Constant containing the project git repo as a **string**.
| `battery_level()` **function**                | Returns the battery level percentage as an **integer**.
| `reset()` **function**                        | Resets the device.
| `reset_cause()` **function**                  | Returns the reason for the previous reset or startup state. These can be either:<br>- `'POWERED_ON'` if the device was powered on normally<br>- `'SOFTWARE_RESET'` if `device.reset()` was called<br>- `'CRASHED'` if the device had crashed.
| `prevent_sleep(enable)`&nbsp;**function**     | Enables or disables sleeping of the device when put back into the charging case. Sleeping is enabled by default. If no argument is given. The currently set value is returned. **WARNING: Running monocle for prolonged periods may result in display burn in, as well as reduced lifetime of components.**
| `force_sleep()` **function**                  | Puts the device to sleep. All hardware components are shut down, and Bluetooth is disconnected. Upon touching either of the touch pads, the device will wake up, and reset.
| `is_charging()` **function**                  | Returns `True` if the Monocle is currently charging. Useful only when `prevent_sleep()` is enabled, otherwise the Monocle automatically turns off when placed on charge.
| `Storage(start, length)` **class**            | The `Storage` class is used internally for initializing and accessing the file system. This class shouldn't be accessed, unless you want to reformat the internal storage. To learn more about how MicroPython handles user files, have a look at the documentation [here](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/esp8266/tutorial/filesystem.html) and [here](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/reference/filesystem.html).

### `display` – Monocle specific

> The display module allows for drawing to the micro OLED display.

| Members | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| `Text(string, x, y, color, justify=TOP_LEFT)` **class**       | Creates a text object at the coordinate `x, y` which can be passed to `display.show()`. `string` can be any string, and `color` should be an RGB hex value with the format `0xRRGGBB`. If the `justify` parameter is given, the text will be justified accordingly from the `x, y` coordinate.
| `Rectangle(x1, y1, x2, y2, color)` **class**                  | Creates a rectangle object which can be passed to `display.show()`. `x1, y1` and `x2, y2` define each corner of the rectangle. `color` should be an RGB hex value with the format `0xRRGGBB`.
| `Fill(color)` **class**                                       | Creates a colored box object which fills the entire screen, and can be passed to `display.show()`. `color` should be an RGB hex value with the format `0xRRGGBB`.
| `Line(x1, y1, x2, y2, color, thickness=1)` **class**          | Creates a line object from `x1, y1` to `x2, y2` which can be passed to `display.show()`. `color` should be an RGB hex value with the format `0xRRGGBB`, and `thickness` can optionally be provided to override the default line thickness in pixels.
| `VLine(x, y, height, color, thickness=1)` **class**           | Creates a vertical line object from position `x, y` with a length of `height` which can be passed to `display.show()`. `color` should be an RGB hex value with the format `0xRRGGBB`, and `thickness` can optionally be provided to override the default line thickness in pixels.
| `HLine(x, y, width, color, thickness=1)` **class**            | Creates an horizontal line object from position `x, y` with a length of `width` which can be passed to `display.show()`. `color` should be an RGB hex value with the format `0xRRGGBB`, and `thickness` can optionally be provided to override the default line thickness in pixels.
| `Polygon([x1, y1, ... xn, yn], color)` **class**              | Creates a polygon object which can be passed to `display.show()`. The first parameter should be a list of coordinates, and `color` should be an RGB hex value with the format `0xRRGGBB`. Polygons are always closed shapes, therefore if the last coordinate does not close the shape, it will be closed automatically.
| `Polyline([x1,y1,...xn,yn],color,thickness=1)`&nbsp;**class** | Similar to the Polygon object, Polyline creates a shape based on a list of coordinates. Unlike Polygon, Polyline does not need to be a closed shape. `color` should be an RGB hex value with the format `0xRRGGBB`, and `thickness` can optionally be provided to override the default line thickness in pixels.
| `show(object_1, ... object_n)` **function**                   | Prints to the display. The passed arguments can be any number of Text, Line, Rectangle, Polygon, or Polyline objects, or any number of lists containing such objects. Objects are layered front to back, i.e. `object_1` is shown on top of `object_n`.
| `move(x, y)` **function**                                     | `move()` can be called as a class method on any printable object to translate its position. `x` and `y` will move the object relative to its current position.
| `move([objects], x, y)` **function**                          | Additionally, `move()` can be called as a standard function to move a list of objects together. This is useful for grouping printable objects together and moving them as layers.
| `color(color)` **function**                                   | `color()` can be called as a class method on any printable object to change its color. `color` should be an RGB hex value with the format `0xRRGGBB`.
| `color([objects], color)` **function**                        | Additionally, `color()` can be called as a standard function to change the color on a whole list of objects. `color` should be an RGB hex value with the format `0xRRGGBB`.
| `brightness(level)` **function**                              | Sets the display's brightness. `level` can be 0 (dimmest), 1, 2, 3, or 4 (brightest). Level 3 is the default.
| `clear()` **function**                                        | Clears the display.

### `camera` – Monocle specific

> The camera module allows for capturing images and transferring them to another device over Bluetooth.

| Members | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| `capture()` **function**                       | Issues an instruction to the FPGA to start capturing a single image. Always overwrites any previously captured image. Once `capture()` returns, the image data can be read out using `read()`.
| `read(bytes=254)` **function**                 | Reads out a number of bytes from the image frame buffer. `bytes` can be overridden to read out less than 254 bytes. A maximum of 254 bytes may be read out at a time. Multiple reads are required to read out an entire image. Once an entire image is read, and no bytes remain, `read()` will return `None`. If the output mode is set to `RGB`, a known number of bytes can be read out, however in `JPEG` mode, the total number of bytes will vary.
| `RGB` **constant**                             | String constant which represents a RGB565 output format.
| `JPEG` **constant**                            | String constant which represents a JPEG output format.

#### Example
{: .no_toc }

```python
import camera
import bluetooth
import ubinascii

# Capture a JPEG image and transfer it over the Bluetooth raw data service
camera.capture()
while data := camera.read(bluetooth.max_length()):
    bluetooth.send(data)

# Capture a JPEG image and shows it as base64 in the REPL (less efficient)
camera.capture()
while data := camera.read(bluetooth.max_length()):
    print(binascii.b2a_base64(data))
```

### `microphone` – Monocle specific

> The microphone module allows for capturing audio and streaming it to another device over Bluetooth.

| Members | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| `record(seconds=5.0,sample_rate=16000,bit_depth=16)`&nbsp;**function** | Issues an instruction to the FPGA to start recording audio for a number of `seconds`. Always clears previously recorded audio. While recording is ongoing, data can be read out using `read()`. `sample_rate` can be either 16000 or 8000. `bit_depth` can be either 16 or 8.
| `read(samples)` **function**                                           | Reads out a number of recorded audio samples from the FPGA as a **bytearray**. Samples are either signed 16bit values, or signed 8bit values, depending on what `bit_depth` was previously set to during recording. Up to 127 samples can be read at a time. **Note** if using 16bit mode, the number of bytes returned are always twice the sample value.

#### Example
{: .no_toc }

```python
import microphone

# Starts a new 4 second recording with 8khz sample rate, and signed 8bit output
microphone.record(seconds=4.0, bit_depth=8, sample_rate=8000)
time.sleep(0.5)  ## A short time is needed to let the FPGA prepare the buffer

samples = bluetooth.max_length() // 2

while True:
        chunk1 = microphone.read(samples)
        chunk2 = microphone.read(samples)

        if chunk1 == None:
            break
        elif chunk2 == None:
            bluetooth_send_message(chunk1)
        else:
            bluetooth_send_message(chunk1 + chunk2)
```

### `touch` – Monocle specific

> The touch module allows for reacting to touch events from the capacitive touch pads on Monocle.

| Members | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| `callback(pad,callback)`&nbsp;**function** | Attaches a callback handler to one, both or either of the touch pads. If `pad` is given as `'BOTH'`, then both pads must be touched to trigger the callback. If `pad` is given as `'EITHER'`, then touching either of the pads will trigger the callback. Otherwise `'A'` or `'B'` can be used to assign separate callback functions to each pad individually. `callback` should be a predefined function taking one argument. This argument will equal the pad which triggered the callback. To unassign a callback, issue `callback(pad, None)`. To view the currently assigned callback for a particular pad, issue `callback(pad)` without the second argument.
| `state(pad)` **function**                  | Returns the current touch state of the touch pads. If `pad` is not specified, either `'A'`, `'B'`, `'BOTH'` or `None` will be returned depending on which pads are currently touched. If `pad` is specified, then `True` or `False` will be returned for the touch state of that pad.
| `A` **constant**                           | String constant which represents Pad A.
| `B` **constant**                           | String constant which represents Pad B.
| `BOTH` **constant**                        | String constant which represents both pads.
| `EITHER` **constant**                      | String constant which represents either pads.

#### Example
{: .no_toc }

```python
import touch

# Define the touch callback function which is triggered upon a touch event
def fn(arg):
    if arg == touch.A:
        print("button A pressed!")
    if arg == touch.B:
        print("button B pressed!")

touch.callback(touch.EITHER, fn) # Attaches the same callback to either of the touch pads
```

### `led` – Monocle specific

> The LED module contains functions to control the red and green LED on the front of Monocle.

| Members | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| `on(color)` **function**             | Illuminates an led. `color` can be either `led.RED` or `led.GREEN`.
| `off(color)`&nbsp;**function**&nbsp; | Turns off an led. `color` can be either `led.RED` or `led.GREEN`.
| `RED` **constant**                   | String constant which represents the red led.
| `GREEN` **constant**                 | String constant which represents the green led.

#### Example
{: .no_toc }

```python
import led
led.on(led.GREEN) # Turns on the green LED
led.on('GREEN') # Also turns on the green LED
led.off(led.GREEN) # Turns off the green LED
led.on(led.RED) # Turns on the red LED
led.off(led.RED) # Turns off the red LED
```

---

### `fpga` – Monocle specific

> The FPGA module allows for communicating with the FPGA over the internal SPI bus.

| Members | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| `read(addr, n)` **function**            | Reads `n` number of bytes from the 16-bit address `addr`, and returns a **bytes object**.
| `write(addr,bytes[])`&nbsp;**function** | Writes all bytes from a given **bytes object** `bytes[]` to the 16-bit address `addr`.
| `run(state)` **function**               | `run(False)` stops and powers down the FPGA. `run(True)` powers up the FPGA and restarts operation. This function should only be using during the FPGA application update process. Once stopped, the camera and display will no longer be configured, and a `device.reset()` would be required to reinitialize them. Calling `run()` without any argument will return the current run state of the FPGA.

#### Example
{: .no_toc }

```python
import fpga

### `bluetooth` - Monocle specific

> The `bluetooth` module can be used to transfer byte data between Monocle and the host Bluetooth device. Bytes can contain any arbitrary data, and avoids having to pollute the REPL interface with printing data out as strings. The [raw data service](#communication) is used for all communications under the `bluetooth` module.

| Members | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
|`send(bytes[])` **function**                   | Sends data from a **bytes object** `bytes[]` over Bluetooth using the [raw data service](#communication). The length of `bytes[]` must be equal to or less than the value returned by the `bluetooth.max_length()` function.
|`receive_callback(callback)`&nbsp;**function** | Assigns a callback to receive data over the [raw data service](#communication). `callback` must be a predefined function taking one argument. The value of the argument will be a **bytes object** `bytes[]` containing the received data. To unbind the callback, issue this function with `callback` set as `None`. If `callback` isn't given when issuing this function, the currently set callback will be returned if it is set.
|`connected()` **function**                     | Returns `True` if the [raw data service](#communication) is connected, otherwise returns `False`.
|`max_length()` **function**                    | Returns the maximum data size the Bluetooth host allows for single transfers.

#### Example
{: .no_toc }

```python
import bluetooth
bluetooth.connected() # Returns True if the Bluetooth is connected. Always true when using the REPL, but useful for saved scripts
len = bluetooth.max_length() # Returns the maximum payload size we can send in one go

str = "hello world"
bluetooth.send(str[:len]) # Sends the string 'hello world' to the host. Limited by the maximum payload size

# Define a callback function which is triggered upon reception of Bluetooth data from the host
def fn(bytes):
    print(bytes)

bluetooth.receive_callback(fn) # Attaches the above function to the receive callback
```

### `time` – Monocle specific

> The time module allows for getting/setting the time and date as well as adding delays into your programs.

| Members | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| `time(secs)` **function**                      | Sets or gets the current system time in seconds. If `secs` is not provided, the current time is returned, otherwise the time is set according to the value of `secs`. `secs` should be referenced from midnight on the 1st of January 1970.
| `now(epoch)` **function**                      | Returns a dictionary containing a human readable date and time. If no argument is provided, the current system time is used. If `epoch` is provided, that value will be used to generate the dictionary. The epoch should be referenced from midnight on the 1st of January 1970.
| `zone(offset)` **function**                    | Sets or gets the time zone offset from GMT as a **string**. If `offset` is provided, the timezone is set to the new value. `offset` must be provided as a string, eg *"8:00"*, or *"-06:30"*.
| `mktime(dict)` **function**                    | The inverse of `now()`. Converts a dictionary provided into an epoch timestamp. The returned epoch value will be referenced from midnight on the 1st of January 1970.
| `sleep(secs)` **function**                     | Sleep for a given number of seconds.
| `sleep_ms(msecs)` **function**                 | Sleep for a given number of milliseconds.
| `ticks_ms()` **function**                      | Returns a timestamp in milliseconds since power on.
| `ticks_add(ticks, delta)` **function**         | Offsets a timestamp value by a given number. Can be positive or negative.
| `ticks_diff(ticks1,ticks2)`&nbsp;**function**  | Returns the difference between two timestamps. i.e. `ticks1 - ticks2`, but takes into consideration if the numbers wrap around.

#### Example
{: .no_toc }

```python
import utime
time.sleep(1.5) # Sleeps for 1.5 seconds
time.sleep_ms(100) # Sleeps for 500ms
time.time(1681236168) # Sets the device system time using UTC timestamp
time.time() # Returns the current time (as a UTC timestamp), based on the system time
time.now() # Returns the current time as a human readable dictionary
```

### `update` - Monocle specific

> The update module allows for firmware upgrades of the MicroPython firmware, as well as the FPGA application over bluetooth. **This library use used automatically by the Brilliant REPL for firmware updates. You generally shouldn't need to call these manually, unless you're implementing your own update process.**

| Members | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| `micropython()`&nbsp;**function** | Puts the device into over-the-air device firmware update mode. The device will stay in DFU mode for 5 minutes or until an update is finished being performed. The device will then restart with an updated MicroPython firmware.
| `Fpga` **class**                  | `Fpga` contains three low level functions which are used to update the FPGA. `Fpga.erase()` erases the existing application, `Fpga.write(bytes[])` sequentially writes in the new application, and `Fpga.read(address, length)` can be used to read back and verify the application. For details on how the FPGA application is updated, check out the [FPGA application updates](#fpga-application-updates) section.

```python
import update
update.micropython() # Reboots the device into update mode for updating the MicroPython firmware
```

## Under the hood
{: .no_toc }

This section describes how data is transferred to and from Monocle over Bluetooth.

For testing everything Bluetooth related, try our the nRF Connect App, for [desktop](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-tools/nrf-connect-for-desktop), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=no.nordicsemi.android.mcp&hl=en&gl=US), or [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nrf-connect-for-mobile/id1054362403).

### Communication
{: .no_toc }

All MicroPython communication, i.e. the REPL interface, is accessed via a single Bluetooth *Service* containing two *Characteristics*.

- **Serial service UUID**: 6e400001-b5a3-f393-e0a9-e50e24dcca9e
- **Serial RX characteristic UUID**: 6e400002-b5a3-f393-e0a9-e50e24dcca9e
- **Serial TX characteristic UUID**: 6e400003-b5a3-f393-e0a9-e50e24dcca9e

The RX characteristic is *write* only, and transports serial string data from the central BLE device to Monocle. The TX characteristic is *notification* only and delivers messages back from Monocle, to the central BLE device.

Each characteristic transports string data of any length up to the negotiated *MTU size - 3 bytes*. Longer strings must be chopped up and will be automatically rejoined on the receiving side by Monocle. Likewise if Monocle wishes to send longer responses than can fit into a single MTU payload, the data will arrive sequentially, and can be concatenated by the central Bluetooth app. The diagram below describes how communication operates between Monocle and a central device.

![Sequence diagram of the Monocle serial data service](/monocle/images/bluetooth-serial-service-sequence-diagram.svg)

A secondary Bluetooth *Service*, again containing two *Characteristics*, is used to transport raw data such as image, audio and firmware update data. The mechanism for the raw data service is similar to the serial data service, aside from the fact that `null` or `0` characters may also be included within the payload.

- **Raw data service UUID**: e5700001-7bac-429a-b4ce-57ff900f479d
- **Raw data RX Characteristic UUID**: e5700002-7bac-429a-b4ce-57ff900f479d
- **Raw data TX Characteristic UUID**: e5700003-7bac-429a-b4ce-57ff900f479d

Raw data transfer may often be bigger than a single MTU payload. Similarly to the serial data, it may need to be broken up into pieces. To help reconstruct the packets sent or received by Monocle, a flag is present at the start of each payload to determine if it's either a starting payload, middle payload, end payload, or a small single buffer payload. The exact mechanisms for different types of data transfer are outlined below.

### Downloading media
{: .no_toc }

Media files such as audio and images may be downloaded from the Monocle using the raw data service mentioned in the [Communication section](#communication). Files may also be sent asynchronously by Monocle when they are ready.

Due to the small payload size of Bluetooth packets, the file may be spit into many *chunks* and need to be recombined by the receiving central device. A flag at the start of each payload indicates if it is the **START**, **MIDDLE** or **END** of the file. A very small file may also be transferred using the **SMALL** flag.

The first payload includes metadata about the file such as the filename (with a relevant file extension) and the file size. The sequence diagram below describes how a file is broken into several parts and the data can be recombined to construct the full file: 

![Sequence diagram of the Monocle raw data service](/monocle/images/bluetooth-raw-data-service-sequence-diagram.svg)

### Firmware updates
{: .no_toc }

Firmware updates are handled in two parts:

- **MicroPython firmware** which runs on the Nordic nRF52 Bluetooth IC.

    The nRF52 contains a bootloader which is able to wirelessly update the firmware. To enter the bootloader mode, the following command can be used:

    ```python
    import update
    update.micropython()
    ```

    Monocle will then reboot, and show as a new Bluetooth device named `DFUTarg`. The [Nordic DFU protocol](https://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/topic/sdk_nrf5_v17.1.0/lib_dfu_transport_ble.html) can then be used to perform an update.

    If you're using the AR Studio for VSCode, firmware updates are handled automatically, however if you wish to implement your own. The [WebREPL project](https://github.com/siliconwitchery/web-bluetooth-repl/blob/main/js/nordicdfu.js) serves as an example of how to implement your own firmware update protocol.

- **FPGA binary image** which is used for display, camera and microphone processing.

    FPGA images can also be loaded wirelessly using Python commands. For simplicity, the FPGA binary is represented here as base64 encoded data, however the `bluetooth.receive_callback()` function can also be used to send bytes more efficiently over the air. 

    Again, the [WebREPL project](https://github.com/siliconwitchery/web-bluetooth-repl/blob/main/js/update.js) serves as an example of how to implement your own FPGA update protocol.

    ```python
    import device
    import update
    import ubinascii

    # Erases the entire application
    update.Fpga.erase()

    # Send exactly 444430 bytes. Each write appends to the already written data
    # There's no limitation on how many bytes you can send, but it should be
    # tuned to match the host MTU length for a faster upload speed
    update.Fpga.write(ubinascii.a2b_base64(b'TWFueSBoYW5kcyBtYWt...lIGxpZ2h0IHdvcmsu'))
    ...
    update.Fpga.write(ubinascii.a2b_base64(b'yBtYWtTWFueSBoYW5kc...cmslIGxpZIHd2h0vu'))

    # Write the special "done" flag at the end of the file
    update.Fpga.write(b'done')

    device.reset()
    ```
